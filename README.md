# -Multi-Slotted-Antenna-for-LTE-5G-Sub-6-GHz-Communication
Designed and simulated a multiband microstrip antenna using HFSS covering Bluetooth Wi-Fi (2.4 GHz), LTE (22/42/43/46) and 5G NR (n77/n78/\\[0.5em]
    79).
Achieved 8 resonant frequencies with return loss as low as –38.8 dB, demonstrating strong impedance matching across band\item  Used slot-loading technique on FR4 substrate (25×50 mm) to generate compact and efficient radiation pattern.
Conducted parametric study by varying slot positions, proving multiband behavior depends heavily on slot configuration.
